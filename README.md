# StorySlam iOS client

StorySlam is an iOS app I developed in 2016 for fun. I am releasing it on GitHub since it is no longer on the app store.

### App Store Description
Collaborate with your friends and users around the globe to write stories!

Teams of 2 to 5 StorySlam authors start with a random prompt and story genre, then decide the ending to their very own tale! Once a story has been started, team members take turns writing one sentence. 

But make sure to hurry, if it is your turn and you wait over 24 hours to write your sentence, your turn will be skipped!

When the story is at least 10 sentences long, authors can decide to end the story and write the final sentence, or continue further. Finished stories can be viewed by friends and the StorySlam community, or they can be shared with anyone through social media or email.
